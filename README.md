The article focuses on the growing threat of ransomware attacks, particularly emphasizing the need for early-stage detection. Ransomware is a type of malware designed to encrypt user information or lock access to infected devices, demanding a ransom for the restoration of access. The paper notes the evolving nature of ransomware, with attackers incorporating sensing activities to evade detection by traditional anti- virus and anti-malware solutions. The key problem addressed is the lack of attention to early-stage detection techniques in existing literature.
The primary aim of the article is to propose an early-stage ransomware detection system using a neural network model for multi-class classification. The authors seek to detect ransomware before the encryption phase by analyzing pre-attack activities. The proposed model is compared against state-of-the-art approaches, showcasing its superior performance, especially on a challenging, large, and varied dataset that the authors compiled. Additionally, the article aims to contribute to the field by making the dataset, source code, and results publicly available for replication and further research. The dataset used in the study is a critical component of the research. The authors compiled a dataset consisting of 5,203 samples, including 4,753 ransomware samples from 12 different families and 450 benign samples.
